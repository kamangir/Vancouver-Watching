# Vancouver Watching (`vanwatch`) ðŸŒˆ

`vanwatch` ðŸŒˆ discovers and ingests images from traffic cameras in an area and then runs [YOLO ðŸš€](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and other vision algo to extract information about urban activity at scale. 


```bash
 > vanwatch help
ðŸŒˆ vancouver_watching-3.47.1
ðŸŒˆ bird watching in downtown Vancouver with AI.

vancouver_watching discover \
	<area> \
	[~upload] \
	[--validate 1]
 . discover <area>.
vancouver_watching ingest \
	<area> \
	[dryrun,~upload] \
	[<object-name>] \
	[--count <-1>]
 . ingest <area> -> <object-name>.
vancouver_watching list <area> \
	[discovery|ingest]
 . list <area>.
vancouver_watching list areas
 . list areas.
```

## Discover and Ingest an Area

To see the list of areas supported by `vanwatch` type in,

```bash
vanwatch list areas
```

-> [list of areas](./data/)

To discover the available cameras in an area type in,

```bash
vanwatch discover vancouver
```

You have generated a `geojson` of [traffic images in the City of Vancouver](./data/vancouver.geojson). Now, you can ingest the traffic images from this area,

```bash
vanwatch ingest vancouver upload
```

You have downloaded a folder of ~600 images.

## set-up

```bash
abcli git clone Vancouver-Watching install
```

To use on [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), generate the seed ðŸŒ±,

```bash
@seed sagemaker
```

Then change the environment to a `PyTorch 2` image, `Python3` kernel, `ml.g4dn.xlarge` instance, and "open image terminal". Then, type in `bash` and paste the seed ðŸŒ±. Then, run,

```bash
vanwatch conda create_env validate
```
