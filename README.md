## Discover and Ingest an Area

To see the list of areas supported by `vanwatch` type in,

```bash
vanwatch list areas
```

As of revision `3.3.1` you should see `iran` ðŸš§ and [`vancouver`](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/web-cam-url-links/map/)

To discover the available cameras in an area type in,

```bash
vanwatch discover vancouver
```

You have generated a `geojson` of [traffic images in the City of Vancouver](./data/vancouver.geojson). Now, you can ingest the traffic images from this area,

```bash
vanwatch ingest vancouver upload
```

You have downloaded a folder of ~600 images.
